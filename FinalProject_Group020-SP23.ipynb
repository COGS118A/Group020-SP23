    "## Abstract\n",
    "The goal of this project is to predict the price of a house based on the features of the house. We will be using the King County House Sales dataset. The dataset contains information about houses sold in King County, Washington between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset contains 21,613 observations and 21 variables. The dataset contains information about the location of the house, the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, the condition of the house, the grade of the house, the square footage of the house, the square footage of the lot, the year the house was built, the year the house was renovated, the zipcode of the house, the latitude and longitude of the house, and the price of the house. We will be using the features of the house to predict the price of the house. We will be using the mean squared error to measure the performance of our model tentatively, as we will reconsider metrics as we work upon the data and see what results we come across.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "Housing for students has been a long going issue for many years and what made us want to create a way to help students find housing and have what they need to make a certain decision, is because we deal with this first hand. We know numerous other students who struggle finding a good home. This project is not necessarily to find the cheapest housing for a student, but a tool to be transparent for a student searching for housing and what to expect. There are many factors to what can come with students struggling with finding good housing. But before we dive into this, let’s look at a glimpse of what UCSD students have to deal with<a name=\"UCSD\"></a>[1].[^](#UCSD). The title alone should be a plain example of how hard it is already for students to get housing to simply go to school. There should not be a competition to get a basic human need, which is a home. In 2022, Stefanie Holden took time to investigate how difficult housing situations are for students. This ultimately motivated us to not just focus on UCSD, but all students as a whole, because this issue is not just concentrated here, but everywhere. Students experienced the struggles of student loans and finding affordable housing<a name=\"housing\"></a>[2].[^](#housing). In 2016, Gene Aromin, Janice Eberly, and John Mondragon, mention there was a 30% decline in housing but a 38% increase in student debt. Situations like this force students to make horrible financial decisions when it comes to housing because there is no real “upfront” cost and numerous hidden fees. What we want to do with this project is eliminate this anonymity and be very forward with students so they know what financial situation they will be getting themselves into. When covid struck, students were forced to find housing off campus, specifically at the start of the virus when not much was known<a name=\"covid\"></a>[3].[^](#covid). Numerous students were forced to cancel contracts and forced to find housing for themselves. Many of these students made rash decisions and just chose housing due to desperation of not knowing what to do. With this project, we aim to eliminate students making rash decisions and to make housing a less stressful choice. Lastly, we want to help students eliminate the need for uncertainty in choosing how to balance their financial plans. UC universities are no stranger to having numerous students who struggle finding housing. But when they do find housing, the students in the long run end up struggling to find and save to pay for said housing<a name=\"jobs\"></a>[4].[^](#jobs). Although this project will not help students find jobs, it will however, help students have that extra layer of confirmation on what they will need to do to save enough money to pay for the overall rent since our project aims to have full disclosure on what will be owed by the students and have no hidden fees whatsoever. In doing so, we hope to eliminate the need for students to suffer on finding a suitable job to pay for fees they may have not expected before commiting to a housing contract.\n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempting to navigate the ever-complicated and confusing real estate market as a recent college graduate with lofty goals and a desire to enter the world of independence and self-reliability can be quite a demoralizing experience.  Websites like Zillow, Redfin, and Apartments.com certainly don't make this issue any easier as they allow you to filter residences by several parameters but either way will still prioritize showing you the residences that are recommended by them or heavy outliers (Ex: very high square footage but one bedroom and bathroom or extremely low square footage but several rooms) as those are the residences they are trying to sell the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this, it can be extremely difficult to understand what you have access to based on your budget or what your budget should look like based on what you want.  This is the precise issue we are attempting to solve.\n",
    "Our project is geared towards absolute transparency.  Our goal is to be able to present realistic price ranges or residence features (bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) based on the input of the consumer.  Our target audience are recent college graduates who are just beginning their journey into the real world and desire to collect realistic information on their potential housing to feel confident in their decisions instead of being thrown whatever property real estate websites are trying to get off their hands.\n",
    "The results of using our project will be representable in two different ways: a cost value window based on the desired residence features, or a set of average residence features based on the desired price of the residence.\n",
    "To speak to the use of ML in this project, we will be using Linear Regression as well as validation and generalizability measures to make accurate predictions for each of the aforementioned result categories.  The goal of the project isn't just to base everything off of our initial dataset but to provide a framework for future housing cost predictions to allow our target audience to utilize our program even if they are only looking for a property two years ahead of time."
