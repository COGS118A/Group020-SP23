    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have **>1k** observations and **>5** variables. I'd prefer more like ***>10k observations and >10 variables***. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "The goal of this project is to predict the price of a house based on the features of the house. We will be using the King County House Sales dataset. The dataset contains information about houses sold in King County, Washington between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset contains 21,613 observations and 21 variables. The dataset contains information about the location of the house, the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, the condition of the house, the grade of the house, the square footage of the house, the square footage of the lot, the year the house was built, the year the house was renovated, the zipcode of the house, the latitude and longitude of the house, and the price of the house. We will be using the features of the house to predict the price of the house. We will be using the mean squared error to measure the performance of our model.\n"

    "Housing for students has been a long going issue for many years and what made us want to create a way to help students find housing and have what they need to make a certain decision is because we deal with this first hand. We know numerous other students who struggle finding a good home. This project is not necessarily to find the cheapest housing for a student, but a tool to be transparent for a student searching for housing and what to expect. There are many factors to what can come with students struggling with finding good housing. Students experienced the struggles of student loans and finding affordable housing [1] (Gotta fix the inline citation https://economicdynamics.org/meetpapers/2017/paper_369.pdf). In 2016, Gene Aromin, Janice Eberly, and John Mondragon, mention there was a 30% decline in housing but a 38% increase in student debt. Situations like this force students to make horrible financial decisions when it comes to housing because there is no real “upfront” cost and numerous hidden fees. What we want to do with this project is eliminate this anonymity and be very forward with students so they know what financial situation they will be getting themselves into. When covid struck, students were forced to find housing off campus, specifically at the start of the virus when not much was known [2] (https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/05/01/students-campus-housing-struggle-make-rent). Numerous students were forced to cancel contracts and forced to find housing for themselves. Many of these students made rash decisions and just chose housing due to desperation of not knowing what to do. With this project, we aim to eliminate students making rash decisions and to make housing a less stressful choice. \n",
